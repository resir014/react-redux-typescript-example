Welcome to the Redux 4 + TypeScript 3.3 example! This example site shows you the ideal project structure, recommended libraries, as well as design pattern on writing type-safe React + Redux app with TypeScript.

This project is intended as a supplement to [this post](https://resir014.xyz/posts/2018/07/06/redux-4-plus-typescript/). To demonstrate it, I created a website which pulls data from the [OpenDota API](https://docs.opendota.com), and display information like professional teams, heroes, as well as top players by hero. This will also demonstrate how to structure your stores for each feature/module in a Redux-enabled app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## Getting started

A Node.js 8.0.0+ setup with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) is recommended.

```bash
# install dependencies
yarn

# ...or if you'd like to use npm instead
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
yarn start

# build for production
yarn build
```
