// Here we use the `action` helper function provided by `typesafe-actions`.
// This library provides really useful helpers for writing Redux actions in a type-safe manner.
// For more info: https://github.com/piotrwitek/typesafe-actions
//
// Remember, you can also pass parameters into an action creator. Make sure to
// type them properly as well.

export const setTheme = (theme: ThemeColors) => {
  localStorage.setItem('theme', JSON.stringify(theme)) // setting the theme to localState
  return action(LayoutActionTypes.SET_THEME, theme)
}
